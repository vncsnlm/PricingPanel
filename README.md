# PricingPanel
Pricing Panel Project

This project is a simple pricing table created using HTML and CSS. 
It utilizes Flexbox and media queries to ensure responsiveness. 
The pricing table consists of different price plans, tiers, and subscription levels, displayed in three horizontal columns on larger screens and a single column on smaller screens.
